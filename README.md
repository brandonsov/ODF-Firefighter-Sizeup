# ODF-Firefighter-Sizeup
Our goal for this android app is to allow the Oregon Department of Forestry the ability to streamline the creation of their fire reports through an online application which would allow information to be passed more easily between fire districts, and provide better information to first responders who arrive on scene.

### Current features: ###
-Creation of fire reports </br>
-Stores data in a Firebase database to be viewable in real time</br>

### Planned features: ###
-Secure login</br>
-Authorization (to prevent anyone who has access the ability to write reports)</br>
-Google Maps integration to locate fires</br>
